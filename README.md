# Mid-term evaluation exercise for the second sprint in Adalab

This is a mid-term evaluation exercise for the second sprint in [Adalab](https://adalab.es/). The main goal of this exercise was to self-assess my knowledge and skills in basic JavaScript after one week learning this language. I received my teacher's feedback on my work and had the chance to improve the exercise.

I intend to update this work whenever I learn some new JavaScript skills!
