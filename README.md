# Number guessing game

This is a mid-term evaluation exercise for the second sprint in [Adalab](https://adalab.es/). The main goal of this exercise was to self-assess my knowledge and skills in basic JavaScript after one week learning this language. I received my teacher's feedback on my work and had the chance to improve the exercise.

It's a simple number guessing game: introduce a number until you win the game!

It's been fully developed using native JavaScript, with no frameworks.

I'm still learning so please, if you spot a bug, want to improve my code or just show me another way to do things, don't hesitate to open an issue or send a PR!
